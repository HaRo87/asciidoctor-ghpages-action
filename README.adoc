= AsciiDoctor GitHub Pages

A GitHub Action that recursively converts every `adoc` file to `html`, renaming resulting `README.html` to `index.html` then pushing all generated html and existing files to the `gh-pages` branch. It also keeps only the latest commit on the `gh-pages` branch, stoping it to grow too much. 

== Live Demo

We use our own poison. This repository is published in http://manoelcampos.com/asciidoctor-ghpages-action/[GitHub Pages here].

== Configuration

The action currently requires no extra configuration. You have to just add it to your yml workflow file and that is it.
You can check a basic https://github.com/manoelcampos/asciidoc-github-template/blob/master/.github/workflows/asciidoctor-ghpages.yml[workflow file here].
