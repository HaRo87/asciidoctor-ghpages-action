= AsciiDoctor GitHub Pages Action

ifdef::env-github[image:https://github.com/manoelcampos/asciidoctor-ghpages-action/workflows/asciidoctor-ghpages/badge.svg[GitHub Pages,link=http://manoelcampos.com/asciidoctor-ghpages-action/]]

A GitHub Action for your CI workflow that recursively converts every `adoc` file to `html`, renaming resulting `README.html` to `index.html` then pushing all generated html and existing files to the `gh-pages` branch. It also keeps only the latest commit on the `gh-pages` branch, stoping it to grow too much. 

After configuring the action, you GitHub Pages will be available at `http://your-username.github.io/your-repository`.
